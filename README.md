# Optimizing-Revenue-Leakage-Profitability-in-the-Hospitality-Sector
Analytics and consulting project from C&amp;A cell IITG.

## Introduction

In the competitive and dynamic hospitality industry, hotels and resorts often face
unexplained revenue leakages, fluctuating profitability, and underutilized service offerings.

These issues can stem from a variety of factors, such as inefficient pricing strategies, low-
performing service segments (e.g., spa, room service, event hosting), poor upselling or

cross-selling, misaligned customer targeting, or seasonal demand mismanagement.
Despite having access to guest behavior data, booking patterns, and service usage metrics,
many mid-sized hotel chains lack a systematic approach to extract actionable insights that
directly improve their revenue streams and overall business model.


## Project Objective
To develop a framework that helps hospitality businesses identify root causes of revenue leakage, propose
data-backed product and pricing strategies, and justify them with business logic and forecasting models(like
Week-on-Week (WoW) and critical business KPIs like Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy %, and ADR).


## Project Components

1. Data Analysis Module 
 Booking trends (weekday vs. weekend, room types) 
 Seasonal occupancy vs. revenue correlation 
 Ancillary service usage (spa, meals, transport, etc.) 
 Customer segmentation based on spending behavior
2. Root Cause Analysis 
 Identify why certain rooms or services underperform 
 Analyze cancellation reasons and last-minute discount patterns 
 Assess competitor pricing models and customer reviews

Example Use Case

A hotel chain experiences declining profits during the off-season. You use data to show that event-hosting
spaces are underbooked and suggest pivoting to co-working spaces during weekdays. You support this with
ROI predictions and a breakdown of additional revenue expected.
